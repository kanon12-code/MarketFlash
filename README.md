# MarketFlash Project:

## Enhancing Business Operations with Data Insights

Welcome to the **MarketFlash Project** repository! This project was created to provide the general department team at **MarketFlash** with a structured database and an insightful Tableau dashboard for analyzing marketing campaign performance. The project journey includes data restructuring, database design, and dashboard visualization to help MarketFlash make data-driven marketing decisions.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following folders, each representing a key step in the project:

### [ERD](./ERD)
This folder includes the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the MarketFlash database. The ERD was designed after discussions with Markus to eliminate redundancy and create a normalized structure.

### [SQL](./SQL)
This folder includes SQL file used to set up and test the MarketFlash database.

### [Viz-Dashboard](./Viz-Dashboard.png)
Contains the final Tableau dashboard that provides insights into campaign performance across various dimensions. The dashboard includes KPIs, visualizations, and filters to enable detailed analysis by channel, location, audience, and campaign type. You can explore the live dashboard on Tableau.
