# MarketFlash Project:

## Enhancing Business Operations with Data Insights

Welcome to the **MarketFlash Project** repository! This project was created to provide the general department team at **MarketFlash** with a structured database and an insightful Tableau dashboard for analyzing marketing campaign performance. The project journey includes data restructuring, database design, and dashboard visualization to help MarketFlash make data-driven marketing decisions.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following folders, each representing a key step in the project:
